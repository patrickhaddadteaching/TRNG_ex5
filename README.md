Repository for Exercise 1.5 of Embedded Cryptography Book Section 9

In this exercise, you can play with a MO-TRNG again
By scanning or clicking on the QR-code you can launch the application and observe how the number of oscillators,the jitter variance and the accumulation time affect the results of 5 black boxes tests that are proposed in the AIS31 and in the FIPS 140-1 suites.

Your goal is to find the the smallest D, for which the generated data would pass all five black box tests.
<p>You should repeat the procedure for all possible <sup>&#x3C3<sub>tot</sub></sup> &#8260 <sub>T<sub>1</sub></sub> and 	N values.</p>
